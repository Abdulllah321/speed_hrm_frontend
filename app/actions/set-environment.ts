  // However, `cookies().set` in server action works for the current domain.
  
  // To share across subdomains, we need to explicitly set the domain.
  // Since we can't easily get the hostname in a server action without passing it,
  // we'll rely on a best-effort approach or require the domain to be passed?
  // Actually, let's try to do it cleanly.
  
  // Ideally, we want to set it on the base domain.
  // Since we are running this on the server, we can't access `window`.
  // But we can just set it on the current domain and let the client side handling remain
  // OR we can try to be smart about it.
  
  // Let's stick to setting it with specific options that `cookies().set` allows.
  // Note: Next.js cookies() API handles the response header setting.
  
  // IMPORTANT: For true cross-subdomain support, we really want to set the domain attribute.
  // But hardcoding it is brittle.
  // A common pattern is to just set it on the client side for cross-subdomain (like we did in the provider).
  // But the user requested a server action.
